#portfolio
I currently use this as my online portfolio page.
It's mostly your basic static HTML/CSS page, with a bit of SASS and Javascript.
I use Bourbon elements to create the side menu.
The design is very minimalistic focusing on text content rather than pictures.

If you like it, you're more than welcome to use the design as your own portfolio.
